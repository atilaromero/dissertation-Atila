This chapter describes some key concepts of neural networks and data carving. Section \ref{sec:feedforward} describes the Multilayer Perceptron, a simple neural network that shows the  main core concepts and techniques used in other more complex neural networks. Section \ref{sec:conv} describes the Convolutional Neural Network, a type of neural network actively used in image classification. Section \ref{sec:lstm} describes the Long Short-Term Memory, a neural network that can label sequences of inputs. Section \ref{sec:datacarving} describes how some authors classify existing data carving techniques.
