% \levelB{Objective}
In this chapter, to address the first research question ``\textbf{How do different neural network models compare to each other in terms of training performance and quality of results?}'', different neural networks are trained and validated at the file fragment identification task. Their accuracy is then compared, to identify which models should be considered or disregarded.
