\subsection{Speech recognition}
The third test, located in the folder ``speech-experiments'', is actually an experiment. Many of the works available using this type of network are focused at speech or text recognition. Therefore speech recognition was chosen as an experiment whose objective was to discover what are the challenges that the use of a LSTM neural network imposes. Using similar works on the speech recognition field, it was expected that the occurrence of eventual problems could be solved using these works as reference or inspiration.

The input of a speech recognition task, which is some kind of wave sound representation, has a very different size when compared to the output, which is text. CTC, as described in section \ref{sec:ctc},
%%%%%
\todo{CTC will be detailed?}
is a convenient solution to perform end to end speech to text conversion because it provides a way to perform back-propagation in this scenario where an unknown number of several consecutive input units are related to to a single output unit.

But, while Keras already has a build-in CTC cost function, called ctc\_batch\_cost, its usage is not as simple as other cost functions of the same framework. These functions only require the predicted and the correct labels, while this CTC cost function also requires the input size and the predicted label size. 

An example included in Kera's own repository
%%%%%
\todo{include reference to imageocr.py}
suggests as a solution to include the loss computation as an extra layer in the network. This layer would receive, besides the previous layer input, the required sizes as two extra inputs, arguing that Keras has no support for a loss function with extra parameters coming from the network. 
While this certainly works, it is unusual. The alternative approach used in this dissertation was to encode the required information as two extra columns on the matrix that stores the correct labels and implement the CTC algorithm as a loss function instead of a layer.
 
Algorithm \ref{alg:ctcloss} shows the code used to split the y\_pred input matrix into three inputs required by Kera's ctc\_batch\_cost function. The result can then be passed to the model.fit() function.

\noindent
\begin{algorithm}
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, numbers=left]
def ctc_loss(y_shape):
  def f(y_true, y_pred):
    y_true = tf.reshape(y_true, y_shape)
    k_inputs = y_pred
    k_input_lens = y_true[:,0:1]
    k_label_lens = y_true[:,1:2]
    k_labels = y_true[:,2:]
    cost = K.ctc_batch_cost(k_labels, k_inputs,
        k_input_lens,k_label_lens)
    return cost
  return f
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{\label{alg:ctcloss}ctc\_loss}
\end{algorithm}

The code that prepares the labels matrix, including the sizes as the two first columns, is presented in algorithm \ref{alg:toctcformat}.

\noindent
\begin{algorithm}

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, numbers=left]
def to_ctc_format(xs,ys, max_ty=None):
  max_tx = np.max([len(i) for i in xs])
  if max_ty == None:
    max_ty = np.max([len(i) for i in ys]) + 3
  assert max_ty >= np.max([len(i) for i in ys]) + 3
  xarr = np.zeros((len(xs), max_tx, xs[0].shape[1]))
  yarr = np.zeros((len(ys), max_ty))
  for i, x in enumerate(xs):
    xarr[i,:len(x)] = x
  for i, y in enumerate(ys):
    yarr[i,:len(y)+2] = [len(x), len(y), *y]
  return xarr, yarr

\subsubsection{Objectives}
The main objective of this set of experiments was to 
learn how different algorithms, parameters, and model choices could affect the training time of a neural network model that translates a sound to the correspondent text. The resulting model was not required to generalize well and was not intended to be used in real life applications.

This focus on speed of learning and disregard for generalization simplifies the dataset handling, as it does not avoid overfitting and allows the use of the same dataset for both training and validation. The assumption used is that the training time of a model with the additional requirement of good generalization would not be fastest than the training time of a model without this requirement. Thus, if a model is not able to be overfitted in a acceptable amount of time, it also would not be a good choice for a more robust training session.

This approach makes experimentation fast in the current scenario, where the goal is to explore the technology, to later apply it in a different problem. But this opens the possibility of also using this approach in speech recognition, as it is a fast way to discard models that do not satisfy an acceptable training time performance. Then, the group of remaining experiments could pass to the next stage, where a proper dataset preparation procedure would be used.

In the current set of experiments, the time to reach maximum accuracy was measured. Given that some Portuguese syllables have indistinguishable sounds, like ``ci'' and ``si'', 100\% accuracy would be unreachable and the target value was lowered.

\subsubsection{Datasets}
%%%%%
\todo{references for gTTS and espeak}
Three dataset sources were hypothetically considered to these experiments, recorded audio files of people speaking, Google's Text To Speech (gTTS) API, and espeak software. Espeak was the selected source, as it was the fastest way to generate audio data corresponding to each syllable. Google's gTTS sounds are more realistic and less ``robotic'', but they are generated remotely and have some restrictions on frequency of requests. Also, there may exist licence restrictions on its use, but this was not checked. Recording people speaking syllables would generate a dataset more adequate for generalization, but also would be the most time consuming option.

Three datasets were generated using espeak for syllables in Portuguese. The first contains only the five vowels, 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'. The second contains 140 syllables, created using a vowel optionally preceded by one of 27 consonant prefixes, 'b', 'br','c', 'cr','d', 'dr','f', 'fr','g', 'gr','j','l', 'lh','m','n', 'nh','p','pr','qu','r','s','t', 'tr','v','vr','x', and 'z'.
The third adds an optional suffix to the previous syllables, 's', 'r', 'l', and 'm', totalizing 700 syllables.

It is important to notice that the direct use of the written text as a label to each sound, without the use of a phonetic alphabet, was possible because the Portuguese language has a good correspondence between the sound and written representation of each syllable. In other languages, like English, the same approach would not be feasible.

Each generated sound was preprocessed by a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm obtained from XXXX,
%%%%%
\todo{reference to ba-dls-deepspeech}
to convert an audio file containing amplitude vs time data to a representation that express frequency vs amplitude vs time. This facilitates the recognition of features by the neural network, as it is expected that the frequency of each sound will have an important role at those features.

\subsubsection{Model}

In the first attempts, the models had only one LSTM layer, usually with 128 units, using dropout of 0.5 and a fully connected layer of 27 outputs. But the results with this configuration, and some variations of it, were unsatisfactory.

The first problem was that the loss would stagnate after some time, resulting in poor accuracy. After the removal of dropout, this behavior was corrected. It is possible that smaller values of dropout could also give the same result, but this alternative was not tested.

But even with a decreasing loss, the network training still was a slow process. It was taking xxxxx 
%%%%%
\todo{rollback and measure}
to learn to recognize only 5 audios of 5 vowels.
Without a similar working model to compare, it was difficult to judge if that training time was normal or not. Some alternative models were tried. While the increase in number of LSTM layers and variations on the quantity of units did not change the results enough, the inclusion of three 1D convolutional layers before the LSTM layer gave dramatic changes in training time.

\subsubsection{Experiment procedure}
Each experiment was separated in a folder, whose name starts with ``v'', ``cv'' or ``cvs'', that indicates the dataset used, and a number to individualize it. On each folder, a Makefile was included to run the experiment.

%%%%%
\todo[inline]{reference to Adam}
All the experiments use the Adam algorithm to perform backpropagation.

The experiments did not take advantage of GPU acceleration and were  conducted on a single computer with 256GB of RAM and with 2 Intel\textregistered Xeon\textregistered E5-2630 v2 processors, with 6 cores each, with 2 hyper-threads per core, or 24 hyper-threads in total. 
The distance measure used in the experiments considered only exact matches as correct answers. As a consequence, the resulting accuracy value only increased above zero after the loss was very low. For a more robust speech recognition application, a less strict distance measure could be a better option.

\subsubsection{v-001}

Experiment v-001 uses a model with three convolutional layers of 16, 8 and 4 units each, followed by a LSTM layer of 64 units and a fully connected layer of 27 output units, with softmax activation.

The code is configured to run for 1000 epochs, with only 5 samples each, one for each vowel, taking 1m08s to run in the hardware used.

\noindent
\begin{algorithm}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, frame=single, numbers=left]
last = l0 = Input(shape=(None,221))
last = Conv1D(16, (3,), padding="same", activation="relu")(last)
last = Conv1D(8, (3,), padding="same", activation="relu")(last)
last = Conv1D(4, (3,), padding="same", activation="relu")(last)
last = LSTM(64, return_sequences=True)(last)
last = Dense(27)(last)
last = Activation('softmax')(last)

model = tf.keras.Model([l0], last)
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{\label{alg:v001}Experiment v-001}
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection{v-002}
Experiment v-002 uses the same model structure of v-001, but uses an abstract class to handle common tasks and uses callbacks to save checkpoints and to decide when to stop training.

It achieves 1.00 accuracy in 1331 epochs, taking 2m14s.

\subsubsection{v-003}

Experiment v-003 adds more convolutional layers to the previous model.  It also adds a TensorBoard callback, which saves more details of the training process in a format that can be read by TensorBoard and used to perform analysis and create graphics.

It achieved 1.00 accuracy in 601 epochs, taking 0m44s.

\noindent
\begin{algorithm}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, frame=single, numbers=left]
last = l0 = Input(shape=(None,221))
last = Conv1D(16, (3,), padding="same", activation="relu")(last)
last = Conv1D(8, (3,), padding="same", activation="relu")(last)
last = Conv1D(8, (3,), padding="same", activation="relu")(last)
last = Conv1D(8, (3,), padding="same", activation="relu")(last)
last = Conv1D(8, (3,), padding="same", activation="relu")(last)
last = Conv1D(8, (3,), padding="same", activation="relu")(last)
last = Conv1D(4, (3,), padding="same", activation="relu")(last)
last = LSTM(64, return_sequences=True)(last)
last = Dense(27)(last)
last = Activation('softmax')(last)

model = tf.keras.Model([l0], last)
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{\label{alg:v003}Experiment v-003}
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection{v-004}
Experiment v-004 adds a maxpool layer after each convolutional layer. The ``data\_format=`channels\_first`'' option specifies the dimension that should be reduced, which should be the data of a single time step. With the default option the MaxPool1D function would reduce the number of time steps.

It achieved 1.00 accuracy in 501 epochs, taking 0m40s.

\noindent
\begin{algorithm}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, frame=single, numbers=left]
maxpool = MaxPool1D(pool_size=2,
                    strides=1,
                    data_format='channels_first')
last = l0 = Input(shape=(None,221))
last = Conv1D(16, (3,), padding="same", activation="relu")(last)
last = maxpool(last)
last = Conv1D(8, (3,), padding="same", activation="relu")(last)
last = maxpool(last)
last = Conv1D(8, (3,), padding="same", activation="relu")(last)
last = maxpool(last)
last = Conv1D(8, (3,), padding="same", activation="relu")(last)
last = maxpool(last)
last = Conv1D(8, (3,), padding="same", activation="relu")(last)
last = maxpool(last)
last = Conv1D(8, (3,), padding="same", activation="relu")(last)
last = maxpool(last)
last = Conv1D(4, (3,), padding="same", activation="relu")(last)
last = maxpool(last)
last = LSTM(64, return_sequences=True)(last)
last = Dense(27)(last)
last = Activation('softmax')(last)

model = tf.keras.Model([l0], last)
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{\label{alg:v004}Experiment v-004}
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection{cv-001}
Experiment cv-001 is based on experiment v-001, but applied the model on a dataset of syllables consisting of a consonant followed by a vowel. It uses a stop condition of accuracy $>=$ 0.6.

The experiment took 3m52s to reach an accuracy of 0.6, but the loss presented stagnation after that.

However, it was observed that the reuse of the model already trained with only the vowels improved the training time. In the current experiment the same model trained in experiment v-001 was used as a starting point in experiment cv-001.

\subsubsection{cv-002}
Experiment cv-002 also uses a source code based on experiment v-002, just changing the dataset and batch size.

A key difference between experiment cv-001 and cv-002 is that in the first, the ``fit'' function was called many times, one for each epoch, while in the later, the ``fit'' function was called only once, specifying the maximum number of epochs that should be run. The disadvantage of calling the ``fit'' function many times is that the internal state of the optimizer algorithm is reset at each interaction, thus causing the observed stagnation of the loss value.

Using a model previously trained with vowels, it achieved 0.90 accuracy on 140 syllables in 4301 epochs , taking 8m6s.

\subsubsection{cv-003}

Experiment cv-003 also uses a source code based on  experiment v-002, but the inclusion of items on the training sample was done gradually. Given that in cv-001 it was observed that training the vowels first improved training time, in experiment cv-003 the initial training dataset included only the vowels first. Then, a new item was added to the training set each time the loss was less than a certain threshold. This was implemented in Keras using a ``fit\_generator'' function and callbacks.

It was noticed that the value of the loss threshold to trigger the increase of training data has an important impact on the overall training time. But none of the values tried, 1.0, 0.5, and 0.3, generated satisfactory results, as in all three cases the training was interrupted after one hour, as it presented a clear disadvantage when compared to the previous experiment, that finished in less than 10 minutes.

\subsubsection{cvs-001}

Experiment cvs-001 uses a source code based on experiment cv-002, which is based on v-002. The difference was the dataset, that also included the suffixes ``s'', ``r'', ``l'', and ``m''.

Using the model previously trained in experiment cv-002, it achieved 0.90 accuracy on 700 syllables in 501 epochs, taking 5m8s.

\subsubsection{cvs-002}
Experiment cvs-002 is identical to cvs-001, but uses the model trained by v-002 instead of the one trained by cv-002.

It achieved 0.90 accuracy on 700 syllables in 1601 epochs, taking 16m21s.
