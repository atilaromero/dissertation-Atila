The best networks found among those examined in all set of experiments are the ``CMCML'' and ``CMCMLL''. Both have similar training times and final accuracy results, as their accuracy curves show. 

Table \ref{tab:carvinglayers} specify the number of output units in each layer of the networks used in the experiments. For the networks with two convolutional layers, those layers are connected together before the LSTM layer. For the convolutional layers, the input number indicates the size of the receptive field.
