The best networks found among those examined in all set of experiments are the ``CLD'', ``CMCML'' and ``CMCMLL''. They have similar training times and final accuracy results. Their accuracy curves are shown in figure \ref{fig:bestnets}.

While a simple feedforward network worked well to classify the beginning of a file, there are better options to classify a block sample taken from the middle of the file.

The convolutional and LSTM layers worked well together, better than either one in isolation.

Table \ref{tab:carvinglayers} specify the number of output units in each layer of the networks used in the experiments. For the networks with two convolutional layers, those layers are connected together before the LSTM layer. For the convolutional layers, the input number indicates the size of the receptive field.

The fact that it was possible to distinguish between JPG and PNG file blocks shows the potential of neural networks to perform data carving, as this filetypes have compression and therefore should present few recognizable structures. The PDF file format introduces another type of challenge, as it can enclose the other two filetypes.
