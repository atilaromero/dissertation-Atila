% \levelC{Hardware}
The experiments did not take advantage of GPU acceleration and were  conducted on a single computer with 256GB of RAM and with 2 Intel\textregistered Xeon\textregistered E5-2630 v2 processors, with 6 cores each, with 2 hyper-threads per core, or 24 hyper-threads in total. 


% \levelC{Software}
The main software and frameworks used to build the experiments were Python 3.6, Jupyter notebook, Tensorflow 1.14.0, Keras 2.2.4-tf, and Fedora Linux 27.

The results obtained are shown in table \ref{tab:pass1}. The entropy measure is the complement of the GovdocsTP column.

Figure \ref{fig:not_random} shows, for each file type, the percent of 512-byte fragments identified as ``structured'', from a sample of 1000 fragments for each file type.

\caption[]{\label{fig:not_random}Estimate of percentage of samples with recognizable structures, using models trained to distinguish each file type from random data. The 87\% value for JPG, for example, means that up to 87\% of the blocks of the JPG dataset have recognizable patterns. Since the assumption of no false negatives was used, the real value, which is unknown, can be lower. The entropy measure proposed is the complement of this value, for example, 13\% for JPG.}%
