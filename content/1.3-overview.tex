The remainder of this document is organized as follows.
Chapter 2 describes some key neural network concepts relevant to this work. 
Chapter 3 analyzes current research on file fragment classification.
Chapter 4 addresses the first research question, comparing the accuracy of fourteen neural network models.
Chapter 5 addresses the second research question, exploring the influence of the number of classes on the accuracy of the models
Chapter 6 addresses the third research question, testing the hypothesis that part of the observed errors is caused by the inability of the models to distinguish high entropy data from random data.    
Finally, chapter 7 concludes the research and includes suggestions for future work.
