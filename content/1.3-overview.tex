    Chapter 2 describes some key neural network concepts relevant to this work. 
    Chapter 3 analyses current research on file fragment classification.
    Chapter 4 address the first research question, comparing the accuracy of fourteen neural network models.
    Chapter 5 address the second research question, exploring the influence of number of classes on the accuracy of the models
    Chapter 6 address the third research question, testing the hypothesis that part of the observed errors are caused by the inability of the models to distinguish high entropy data from random data.    
    Finally, chapter 7 concludes the research and includes suggestions for future work.
