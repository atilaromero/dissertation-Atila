    Chapter 2 describes some key neural network concepts relevant to this work. 
    Chapter 3 analyses current research on file fragment classification.
    Chapter 4 address the first research question, comparing the accuracy of fourteen neural network models.
    Chapter 5 address the second research question, exploring the influence of number of classes on the accuracy of the models
    Chapter 6 address the third research question, testing the hypothesis that part of the observed errors are caused by high entropy data misinterpreted as random data.    
    Finally, chapter 7 concludes the research and includes suggestions for future work.
