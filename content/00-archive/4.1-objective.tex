The objective of the experiments described in this section 
was to compare the accuracy level of different neural networks with a short training time constraint and using only a small training dataset, at the filetype identification task.

\todo[inline]{este é o foco do trabalho, identificação do tipo de arquivo?}

This objective should give a direct answer to the first research question ``How does different neural network models compare to each other in terms of training performance and quality of results?'', but the constraints imposed to the examined networks are related to the second question ``Which neural network models would be more suitable to accept the addition of new file types by the forensic examiners community?'', because in order to facilitate the creation of models by a community that does not necessarily will have expensive hardware, plenty of time, or extensive knowledge on neural networks, the types of networks that would be desirable to find are the ones that are fast to train.
