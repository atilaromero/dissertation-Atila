To test if 
the LSTM layer could be replaced by 
another way of aggregating the convolutional layer outputs, three networks were constructed without any LSTM layer.

One of them, ``CM'' uses a stride of one and aggregates the results using a big max pooling layer.

Another one, ``CCM'' uses the same strategy, but includes another convolutional layer before the max pooling.

The last one, ``CD'', uses a bigger input window of 64 units, but with a smaller stride of 8 units. The output layer is a fully connected layer.

The results are shown in table \ref{tab:carvingnolstm}. The ``CL'' network is included for comparison.
These three networks produced similar results, but they are not as good as the ``CL'' network, as can be seen in figure
\ref{fig:nolstm}.
