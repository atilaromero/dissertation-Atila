The following questions are intended to be answered in future works: 

\begin{enumerate}[itemindent=\parindent,label=\textbf{Q\arabic*.}]

    \item Could a neural network based tool support a wider range of file types?
    
    \item Could a neural network based tool handle fragmentation through reassembling?
    
    % \item Do the results obtained with usual datasets reflect what happens in real scenarios?

    \item Do LSTM neural networks help to interpret internal file structures?

\end{enumerate}
