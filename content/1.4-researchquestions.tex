%from pep 4.1, paragrafo 1
The major objective of this study is to advance the research on the use of neural networks to perform data carving, answering the following initial question:

%from pep 4.1
\begin{enumerate}[itemindent=\parindent,label=\textbf{Q\arabic*.}]

    \item How does different neural network models compare to each other in terms of training performance and quality of results?
    
    \item Which neural network models would be more suitable to accept the addition of new file types by the forensic examiners community? 

\end{enumerate}
