% main objective: lstm on data carving
%from pep 4.1, paragrafo 1
The major objective of this study is to advance the research on the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to perform data carving, answering the following initial question:

%from pep 4.1
\begin{enumerate}[itemindent=\parindent,label=\textbf{Q\arabic*.}]

    \item How does LSTM compare to other techniques in terms of training performance and quality of results?
    
    \item Which LSTM-based models would be more suitable to accept the addition of new file types by the forensic examiners community? 

\end{enumerate}
