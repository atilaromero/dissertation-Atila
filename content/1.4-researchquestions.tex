% main objective: lstm on data carving
%from pep 4.1, paragrafo 1
The major objective of this study is to advance the research on the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to perform data carving, answering the following initial questions:

%from pep 4.1
\begin{enumerate}[itemindent=\parindent,label=\textbf{Q\arabic*.}]

    \item Could a LSTM-based tool support a wider range of file types?
    
    \item Could a LSTM-based tool handle fragmentation through reassembling?
    
    \item Could a LSTM-based tool accept the addition of new file types by the end-user, in a collaborative manner? 

    \item How does LSTM compare to other techniques in terms of training performance and quality of results?
    
    \item Do the results obtained with usual datasets reflect what happens in real scenarios?

    \item Do LSTM neural networks help to interpret internal file structures?

\end{enumerate}
