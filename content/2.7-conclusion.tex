In this study, the types of layers described, the fully-connected layer of the Multilayer Perceptron, the convolutional and maxpooling layers of Convolutional Neural Networks, and the layers of the Long Short-Term Memory architecture, will be combined in different ways to create models to classify file fragments. Of the three data carving steps mentioned, identification, validation, and reassembling, this study focuses only in the identification one. It also focuses on file fragments, in contrast with the easier task of whole file classification, which can rely on headers and footers.
