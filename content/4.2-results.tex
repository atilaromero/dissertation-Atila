%\levelB{Hardware}
The experiments did not take advantage of GPU acceleration and were  conducted on a single computer with 256GB of RAM and with 2 Intel\textregistered Xeon\textregistered E5-2630 v2 processors, with 6 cores each, with 2 hyper-threads per core, or 24 hyper-threads in total. 

%\levelB{Software}
The main software and frameworks used to build the experiments were Python 3.6\todo{ref}, Jupyter notebook\todo{ref}, Tensorflow 1.14.0\todo{ref}, Keras 2.2.4-tf\todo{ref}, and Fedora Linux 27.
The source code for the experiments is available at \sloppy\url{http://github.com/atilaromero/carving-experiments}.

%\levelB{Dataset}
To prepare the Govdocs1 dataset \cite{garfinkel_bringing_2009}, 200 files of each of the 28 chosen file types were randomly selected, 100 to use in the training dataset and 100 to use in the validation dataset.
%\levelB{Inputs}
A batch size of 100 was used, with 28 steps per epoch.

The two models that used LSTM layers without convolutional layers presented slower learning in comparison with the others, as can be seen in figure \ref{fig:learning}. The final validation accuracy values can be consulted in figure \ref{fig:models}.

The validation accuracy values of the remaining models were in the 0.35-0.54 range.
To check if the two slower models could give better results if executed for a longer period, they were trained for 10 hours\todo{why?}. The model identified as ``LD'', which uses an LSTM layer followed by a fully connected layer, was able to achieve an accuracy of 0.494, while the other, ``LL'', achieved only 0.153.

% \levelC{Limitations and threats to validity}
The model ``CLD'' was chosen to be compared with other works because it was among the three models with the highest accuracy, but achieved its results in less time and showed high resilience to changes in parameters during the tests, while the others did not.

In this second stage, using longer training sessions, the accuracy for the 28 file types used in the first stage increased from 0.54 to 0.63. Using the same file types of other works, the ``CLD'' model achieved an accuracy of 
0.67 for the file types from Chen \textit{et al.} \cite{chen_file_2018},
0.91 for Hiester \cite{hiester_file_2018}, 
0.59 for Wang \textit{et al.} \cite{wang_sparse_2018},
0.65 for Wang \textit{et al.} \cite{wang_file_2018},
and
0.61 for VulinoviÄ‡ \textit{et al.} \cite{vulinovic_neural_2019}.
The results can be seen in figure \ref{fig:cldothers}.
