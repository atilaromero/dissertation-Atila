\section{Filetype identification}
The objective of the experiments described in this section was to investigate which neural network models would be more adequate to the filetype identification task and to be used in subsequent research stages.
\subsection{Datasets}
Two 


train
dev (eyeball, blackbox)
test

training set from different source

dev and test sets from same source

Datasets:
- govdoc1: 1000 subsets. use minimal subsets as possible during training.
Start with subset only two subsets dev and test. Add other subsets do dev later if needed.

- individual files gathered from multiple sources : train, dev, test
on demand, as govdoc begins to fail on dev set




\subsection{Exp01 - 3 files, by sectors}
3 files
identification of sectors
