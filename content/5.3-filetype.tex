\section{Filetype identification}
\subsection{Datasets}
train
dev (eyeball, blackbox)
test

training set from different source

dev and test sets from same source

Datasets:
- govdoc1: 1000 subsets. use minimal subsets as possible during training.
Start with subset only two subsets dev and test. Add other subsets do dev later if needed.

- individual files gathered from multiple sources : train, dev, test
on demand, as govdoc begins to fail on dev set



\subsection{Exp01 - 3 files, by sectors}
3 files
