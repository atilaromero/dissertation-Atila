Among the examined networks, while many of them satisfy the requirements imposed and could potentially be used by a forensic examiner to create a model to a new file type, the networks that showed the best results are those that use convolutional layers to split and process the input and then use LSTM layers to analyse the series of outputs produced by the convolutional layers. This gives a direct answer to the first research question, ``How does different neural network models compare to each other in terms of training performance and quality of results?''.

To answer the second question, ``Which neural network models would be more suitable to accept the addition of new filetypes by the forensic examiners community?'', a set of constraints were imposed to the analyzed models. The achieved results can be replicated with little computational power, in a short time period and with a limited dataset.

To create models that recognize new filetypes, a forensic examiner would have to gather a small dataset for each filetype that needs to be recognized. Datasets of 100 files were sufficient to run the experiments in this work, but it is possible that even smaller datasets could be used. Then, a network with two convolutional layers with max pooling followed by a LSTM layer could be used to quickly train a new model, without the requirement of special hardware. In the chosen framework, Keras, the export and import of models can be easily done, so the forensic examiner could export and publish the new model in a public repository.
