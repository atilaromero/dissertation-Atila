Among the examined networks, many satisfy the requirements imposed and could potentially be used by a forensic examiner to create a model to a new file type. This task could be done with little computational power, in a short time period and with a limited dataset. The networks that showed the best results are those that use convolutional layers to split and process the input and then use LSTM layers to analyse the series of outputs produced by the convolutional layers.
