Datasets for three different file types, JPG, PDF, and PNG, were obtained from online sources.

The PDF files were retrieved from http://arxiv.org/pdf/, which stores them using a sequential nomenclature. The training dataset uses the files 1904.10000.pdf to 1904.10099.pdf, development 1904.10100.pdf to 1904.10199.pdf, and test 1904.10200.pdf to 1904.10299.pdf. 

The JPG samples were obtained in ftp://ftp.inrialpes.fr/pub/lear/douze/data/jpg1.tar.gz  \cite{jegou_hamming_2008}, and 100 images were assigned to training, 100 to development and the remaining 612 to test.
