\section{Environment validation procedures}
Before starting to experiment directly with different data carving models,
some tests dealing with other more popular problems were performed.
The goal of this approach was to test the Keras and TensorFlow environment, to learn machine learning techniques using these tools, and to validate the machine learning coding procedure.

The following three subsections, Dinosaurs names, Shakespeare, and Speech recognition, describe those tests.

\input{content/4.1.3-speech.tex}
