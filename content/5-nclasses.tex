% \levelB{Objective}
In Chapter \ref{sec:evalmodels}, it was observed that achieving accuracy values above 60\% on file fragment classification using 28 classes was a difficult task to the considered models. In other studies results \cite{hiester_file_2018} \cite{sportiello_context-based_2012} \cite{amirani_feature-based_2013} \cite{maslim_distributed_2014} and on initial tests, the achieved accuracy for a small number of classes was considerably higher. Hiester \cite{hiester_file_2018}, for instance, achieves an accuracy of 98\% using four classes.

To address the second research question 
``\textbf{How does the accuracy of neural network models changes relative to the number of classes?}'', 
this chapter describes several neural network training sessions using different sets of file types and the attempt to understand how the accuracy of the resulting models are affected by composition of file types in the set.
