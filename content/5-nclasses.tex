In chapter \ref{sec:evalmodels}, it was observed that achieving accuracy values above 0.6 on file fragment classification using 28 classes was a difficult task to the considered models. In other studies results \cite{hiester_file_2018} \cite{sportiello_context-based_2012} \cite{amirani_feature-based_2013} \cite{maslim_distributed_2014} and on initial tests, the achieved accuracy for a small number of classes was considerably higher. Hiester \cite{hiester_file_2018}, for instance, achieves an accuracy of 98\% using four classes.

This chapter describes how does the accuracy of neural network models changes relative to the number of classes in the dataset.
